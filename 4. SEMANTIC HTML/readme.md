- **`<header>`**: Contains introductory content or navigational links for the site.  
- **`<nav>`**: Defines navigation links.  
- **`<main>`**: Represents the primary content of the document.  
- **`<footer>`**: Contains footer information like copyrights and links.  
- **`<section>`**: Groups thematic content, such as chapters or sections.  
- **`<article>`**: Encapsulates content that stands alone, like blogs or news.  
- **`<aside>`**: Holds tangentially related content, like sidebars or ads.  
- **`<figure>`**: Wraps media such as images, diagrams, or code snippets.  
- **`<figcaption>`**: Provides a caption or description for the `<figure>`.  
- **Media Elements (`<video>`, `<audio>`, `<embed>`)**: Used for embedding multimedia content.  

By integrating these elements, your website will be more meaningful, easier to navigate, and compliant with modern web standards.
