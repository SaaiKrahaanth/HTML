# HTML Tables Summary

In this lesson, we covered the basics of creating and formatting tables in HTML:

- **`<table>`**: Creates the table.
- **`<tr>`**: Adds rows to the table.
- **`<td>`**: Adds data to the rows.
- **`<th>`**: Adds headings to clarify the data.
- **`colspan`**: Allows table data to span multiple columns.
- **`rowspan`**: Allows table data to span multiple rows.
- **`<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tfoot>`**: Split the table into sections for better organization.

Additionally, all the CSS properties learned in the course can be applied to style tables and their data.
