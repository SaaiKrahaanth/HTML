# Wine Festival Schedule

In this project, we created a table to display the schedule for the Aguillar Family's Wine Festival.

### Key Points:

- **Table Structure**: Used `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<th>` elements.
- **Event Title**: Spanning across two columns using `colspan="2"` in `<th>`.
- **Headings**: Added a row for "Time" and "Event" using `<h2>`.
- **Body Content**: Created 5 rows with times (12:00 PM - 04:00 PM) and events such as "Welcome Reception," "Storytelling & Tasting," and more.
- **Styling**: Used `<h3>` for times and event names.

### Tasks Completed:
1. Created a table within a container.
2. Added headings and columns for Time and Event.
3. Listed event details with times and names.

Cheers to a successful Wine Festival schedule table!
