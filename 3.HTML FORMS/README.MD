# HTML Forms Summary

In this lesson, we learned how to create and interact with forms for user input.

### Key Concepts:
- **Purpose of `<form>`**: Allows users to input and send information.
- **Attributes**:
  - `action`: Specifies where the form data is sent.
  - `method`: Determines how the data is sent (e.g., GET, POST).

### Input Types:
- `text`: Single row text input.
- `password`: Censored text input.
- `number`: Numeric input.
- `range`: Slider for selecting a number range.
- `checkbox`: A single checkbox.
- `radio`: A radio button, paired with others.
- `submit`: Creates a submit button.
- `text` with `list`: Pairs with `<datalist>` for searchable options.

### Additional Elements:
- `<select>`: Dropdown menu populated with `<option>` elements.
- `<datalist>`: Searchable options linked to an `<input>`.
- `<textarea>`: Customizable text input area.

### Form Submission:
- Sends data as `name=value` pairs.

By combining `<form>` with these elements, we can create user-friendly websites tailored to user needs. Apply these concepts to enhance your projects!
